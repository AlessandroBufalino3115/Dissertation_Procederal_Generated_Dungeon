 * vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv to do vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
 * 
 *      
 *   WFC the last issue is that on the extreme corners it doesnt work and thats it   
 *      
 *   The fact that the marching cubes does what it does is annoying , there needs to be a way toeither flatten or not draw the other tris
 * 
 *   for delu do somethign either spanw the points at rnadom and use the triangluation to draw the corridors of use poisson, the workflow should be similar to the L-system
 * 
 *   there is the issue of the redrawing in the BPS and all of those thigns with the additive   --  addition will not be added
 *   Need to add room to room connection
 *   
 *   Look into making the flow better with less time wasted
 *   
 *   weigthed tiles spawn
 *   
 *   A flood fill algo that fails should mean that a boundary is reached, to look into to redo the wall checker
 *   
 *   k-group/mean to find regions? but what could regions be needed for? different tileset spawn
 *   
 *   look into different textures for the marching cubes
 *   
 *   
 *   still need to add:
 * 
 *   GRAPH GRAMMAR
 *   OTHER PATHFINDINGS
 *   PERLIN WORMS  --  to check
 *   fix diamond square
 *
