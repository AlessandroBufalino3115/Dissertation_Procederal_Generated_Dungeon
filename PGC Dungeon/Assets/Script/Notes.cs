 * 
 *   for delu do somethign either spanw the points at rnadom and use the triangluation to draw the corridors of use poisson, the workflow should be similar to the L-system    ---   mid priority
 * 
 *   there is the issue of the redrawing in the BPS and all of those thigns with the additive   ---  addition will not be added     high priority
 *   
 *   Need to add room to room connection    --- high priority
 *   
 *   Look into making the flow better with less time wasted    --- mid priority
 *   
 *   create rooms from corridors   --- high priority
 *   
 *   weigthed tiles spawn   --- high priority
 *   
 *   Fix the graph thing placement --- mid priority
 *   
 *   Ui builder in the window thing  --- to look into

 *   
 *   A flood fill algo that fails should mean that a boundary is reached, to look into to redo the wall checker      --- minor priority
 *   
 *   k-group/mean to find regions? but what could regions be needed for? different tileset spawn    --- minor priority
 *   
 *   look into different textures for the marching cubes     --- minor priority
 *   
 *   
 *   
 *   
 *   still need to add:
 * 
 *   GRAPH GRAMMAR  -- mid priority
 *   OTHER PATHFINDINGS   -- high priority       Might drop BFS and Do DFS only
 *   PERLIN WORMS  --  to check    -- mid priority
 *   fix diamond square   -- high priority
