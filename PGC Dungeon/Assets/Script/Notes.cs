 *   There is an issue with the WFC algo, it is a coding index issue, the other edges when given a the outer tile on the lefr and right edges they throw errors. ,most likely an index issue
 * 
 *   The fact that the marching cubes does what it does is annoying , there needs to be a way toeither flatten or not draw the other tris
 * 
 *   for delu do somethign either spanw the points at rnadom and use the triangluation to draw the corridors of use poisson, the workflow should be similar to the L-system
 * 
 *   there is the issue of the redrawing in the BPS and all of those thigns with the additive   --  addition will not be added
 *   Need to add room to room connection
 *   
 *   Look into making the flow better with less time wasted
